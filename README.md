# BAM
A File Sharing Web Application
  Repository for the code dedicated to the management of the BAM! project for CSE115A at UCSC for the Spring '22 quarter.

# getting-started-with-UI
## Step 1:
  Install Node v16.14.0 to your computer (use homebrew or install from website). Confirm version by running: 'node --version'
## Step 2:
  Install npm v8.3.1 to your computer. Confirm by running: 'npm --version'
## Step 3:
  Go into client directory: 'cd client'
  Run the command: 'npm install'
  This will install the bootstrap framework and other packages to your computer locally. These files will be in the .gitignore so that we are not constantly pushing ~20gb of the framework unneccesarily.
